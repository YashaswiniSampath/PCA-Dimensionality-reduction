# PCA-Dimensionality-reduction

Through this project, I gained a comprehensive understanding of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and various dimensionality reduction techniques including t-SNE, LLE, and MDS. I explored image reconstruction. The project also covered clustering methods like K-Means and EM, as well as building and training neural networks. I enhanced my skills in visualization techniques, evaluating models using metrics such as disparity and correlation coefficient, and optimizing models through hyperparameter tuning and learning rate adjustments. Additionally, I developed proficiency in data preprocessing, loading, and visualizing model performance in terms of loss and accuracy. I applied clustering techniques such as the elbow method and silhouette method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
